## The Problem

You have a sponsor lined up to pay for space, or food, or drinks, but you don't want to hold the cash in a personal bank account.

## The Pattern

Have the sponsor pay the vendor directly.

This can be as simple as having the sponsor pay the pizza delivery person, or running to the package store with you.

It can be as involved as having the sponsor arrange everything. Some sponsors even have a preferred vendor that they already work with.

## Example

Up to three examples should suffice.

### A First Example

Here's where you illustrate this pattern, by giving an example of how you've seen it applied.

Feel free to call out specific user groups that you've seen make this work!
