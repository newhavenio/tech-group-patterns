Congratulations on starting a local tech community! And, on behalf of tech communities everywhere, thank you.

Organizing a local tech community is tricky. Many organizers start with plenty of technical skill, a good chunk of introversion, and a vague desire to talk shop; if they're successful, and lucky, they find themselves on a journey that requires people and organizing skills, some extroversion, and clarity of purpose.

This guide is a collection of patterns that can help. Like traditional design patterns, each pattern addresses a problem, in a context; a pattern that's universally-useful is rare. This is especially true, given that tech communities come in different sizes (<100 members, 100-1000 members, 1000-10000 members, >10000 members) and styles (niche, general), live in different communities (wealthy, poor, rural, urban, university towns, sparse, dense) with different kinds of resources (available space to meet, local sponsor companies in relevant industries, transit and parking options). Each pattern should note the problem it's trying to solve, the kind of group(s) it's applicable to.

At this time, some of these patterns might be more hypothetical than road-tested. Each pattern should have a few examples of where it's been used, and how it turned out; if a pattern doesn't have that, we'll note it - if you experiment with it, please write up your experience and make a pull request! This pattern repository can act as a queue of experiments waiting to happen. (If everyone who tries a pattern has bad results, maybe we'll start an Anti-patterns section.) (TODO tag patterns as "Needs Evidence," or "Needs Case Study." "Needs Experience Report.")

Don't feel like you need to use every pattern here. They won't all apply to your group's situation, or its needs. And trying too many things at once can burn you out. But it's ok to get [inspired you to build](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-forums/) - in fact, it's great.

The organization of this guide, and the patterns, is still in flux. As we collect patterns, we'll try to organize them in a sensible way.

# Current Status

Everything about this guide should be considered in-flux - even the repo name. The eventual goal is to have an open github repo, with a gh-pages branch, so it serves as a website. All the content will be Creative Commons, or public domain, or something very open.

The patterns still need to be written up.

# How You Can Help

Can you write up one of the pattern-stubs? Write it up, following the basic template (TODO define that and make an example), and make a pull request.

Can you suggest a pattern? Write it up, following the basic template (TODO define that and make an example), and make a pull request.

Do you have experience with one of the patterns that needs an experience report? Write up your experience, and make a pull request.

## Possible Patterns

* road trip to rural areas (geekharvest.org)
* Call your mayor
* Find successful big-city speakers who grew up in your town
* find successful meetup organizers in your area, and ask for tips

## Possible Patterns to Test

* short curriculum arcs
  * 3 classes in series
